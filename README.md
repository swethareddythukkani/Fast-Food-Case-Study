Market Segmentation Using Advanced Clustering Methods

üìå Project Overview

This project explores market segmentation using advanced clustering techniques, leveraging real-world data to categorize customers effectively. By integrating distance-based metrics, hierarchical clustering, partitioning methods, hybrid approaches, and model-based clustering, the project enhances customer segmentation strategies for targeted marketing and data-driven decision-making.
